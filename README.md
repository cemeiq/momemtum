## 🗣️ About this project

I wanted to create a simple Google Clone mometum while learning ReactJS hence I came up with this idea. We build a Google Momentum Clone using Axios to talk to our different APIs.  Axios is a promised-based HTTP Client for node which makes talking with APIs clean and simple. We use React Hooks such as useState and useEffect to work with Axios.
